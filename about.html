In fact, our geographical footprint extends beyond Earth, with our engines now powering many of India's space missions.With a revenue of over USD 4.1 billion we are growing fast, and have exciting, ambitious aspirations.But for us, it is most important that besides our strong financial performance and innovative, much-loved products, we remain a good company. Approximately 23 per cent of the promoter holding in the Godrej Group is held in trusts that invest in the environment, health and education. We are also bringing together our passion and purpose to make a difference through our Good & Green strategy of 'shared value' to create a more inclusive and greener India.<p>
